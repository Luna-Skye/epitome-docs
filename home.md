### Our Goal
Our goal within Epitome is to provide a safe and fun environment for SCP: Secret Laboratory, somewhere to play without being greeted by bigotry, racism, or any kind of negativity. We try to be as laid back as possible so long as player's experience isn't diminished.

### Regarding Staff Applications
If you're looking for to apply for a role as a staff member, please do at least read our [Staff Guidelines](staff-guidelines.md) and then head over to this [Google Form]() and fill it out.

If you've already filled out that form, please take some time to look through some documentation.
