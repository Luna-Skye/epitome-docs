### Our Goal
Our goal within Epitome is to provide a safe and fun environment for SCP: Secret Laboratory, somewhere to play without being greeted by bigotry, racism, or any kind of negativity. We try to be as laid back as possible so long as player's experience isn't diminished.

### Legacy Documentation
Most of this should be already covered here, but it might be helpful if there are still some gaps to fill.
