# Staff Guidelines
These are the basic guidelines on how you're expected to behave as a staff member of the Epitome SCP Server, as well as some important information regarding moderating the server.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding these guidelines, please do bring them up with the server owner through Discord.<br>
We're willing to hear you out and take any criticism into consideration. Please do not be afraid to ping me on Discord, I generally don't mind.


## Moral Values
To be a staff member, we hope you share moral values that are at least similar to what we have in mind of the server and it's representation. Our goal is to be the most accepting, safe place on SCP: SL, where you won't be greeted with bigotry, racism, homophobia, or any sort of hatred.<br>
Regardless of who or where behavior like this stems from within the community, it should and will be addressed if possible.

This includes more sensitive and divisive topics such as LGBTQ+ matters, political topics, religious views, etc. You are NOT expected to think of or see these topics the same way we do, but everyone within the community is expected to treat each other with respect.

Respect people's pronouns, names, sexualities, opinions, etc. This falls directly in line with Rule #1 regarding racism, homophobia, transphobia, and other kinds of hate speech.<br>
This obviously extends into other areas, such as race and political views. It's best to just respect people, recognize opinions on divisive topics, and be a decent person.

## Handling Rulebreakers
Generally we work on a singular warning basis.<br>
If a player is caught or reported for breaking a rule, they should be given a direct warning either via [Private Broadcast](/staff-resources?id=broadcasting-messages) or (preferably) a verbal warning by [jailing](/staff-resources?id=jailing-players) the player and yourself then speaking to them directly. Please make sure it's clear they broke a specific rule, and suggest they read through the rules to avoid a ban.<br>
If the same player is **caught** breaking rules again, ban them for the appropriate amount of time.<br>
However, if the same player is simply reported, please observe them in order to catch them breaking a rule, to ensure players aren't just trolling or attempting to get an innocent player banned.

If a player is being overly disrespectful toward staff members either during or after a warning, such as cursing out staff or other player's for reporting their behavior, this illicits a ban under breaking Rule #4.

Once you have <font color={{col-orange}}>warned</font> or <font color={{col-red}}>banned</font> a player, it is required to be logged in the `#ban-logs` Discord channel. Make sure to clarify if it was a warn or a ban, as well as the length (if applicable), the reason, and the username you warned. It is highly recommended to add a ban reason when banning a player, and this likely be required in the future.

If someone leaves during a warning, this is grounds for an immediate ban respecting the Ban Length of the broken rule if they return. It is clear they're avoiding any warning or punishment and don't intend to behave any differently.

## Rule Clarification
Some of our rules are a little vague in their wording or clarification, mostly due to keeping the ServerInfo clean and minimal.<br>
So here we'll go over some of the rules and clarify a bit as to what they mean.
1. **<font color={{col-red}}>No racism, homophobia, transphobia, hate speech, or discrimnation of any kind.</font>**<br>
   *Base Ban Length: <font color={{col-red}}>Medium-Long</font>*<br>
   This is something somewhat opinionated, which makes it a little difficult to clarify. However it should go without saying that certain phrases and words are racist, homophobic, or transphobic. These words, depending on the severity, targeted person, and previous incidents regarding the offender, could either elicit an immediate ban or a verbal warning after being [jailed](#).
2. **<font color={{col-red}}>No cheating, exploits, glitches, or anything game breaking.</font>**<br>
   *Base Ban Length: <font color={{col-blue}}>Short</font>*<br>
   This rule rarely gets broken, but it follows the same approach. This includes things similar to the glitch where players are able to get into the closed off, inaccessible windowed room at Heavy Containment checkpoints.
3. **<font color={{col-red}}>Do not team kill.</font>**<br>
   *Base Ban Length: <font color={{col-orange}}>Short-Medium</font>*<br>
   The most broken rule on the server. Crossfire is to be forgiven, however if it becomes excessive or blatantly intentional teamkilling, follow the general approach for all rule breaks. This includes any form of TK, elevator grenades/balls, shooting teammates (see [Allowed Teams](#)), etc.
4. **<font color={{col-red}}>Do not impersonate or disrespect staff.</font>**<br>
   *Base Ban Length: <font color={{col-orange}}>Short-Medium</font>*<br>
   It is not okay to claim you are a staff member, nor blatantly disrespect a staff member. Trash talk is one thing and is just a part of a game, but do not verbally attack or abuse staff members due to you breaking rules and being warned.

## Ban Lengths
Once ban timers are up, offenders could come back and continue breaking rules.<br>
In the case that a previous offender returns, it's recommended to keep an eye on them to ensure that they do not continue breaking rules.<br>
If they do continue breaking rules, this warrants another ban with increased time.

Moderators can only ban up to one (1) day, however Admins are able to ban up to fifty (50) years. If someone needs to be repeatedly banned and you reach your limit, please bring it to an Admin's attention through the `#reports` channel on Discord.

We consider ban lengths within three (3) tiers.
- **<font color={{col-blue}}>Short</font>** bans are between *5-30 minutes*
- **<font color={{col-orange}}>Medium</font>** bans are between *30 minutes to 1 day*
- **<font color={{col-red}}>Long</font>** bans are anything *above 1 day*

If a player is breaking a multitude of rules at once, we recommend using the most severe length while respecting which rules were broken. For example, if they were being racist, teamkilling, and disrespecting staff, that illicits a *full-day* ban, seeing as racism is the most severe offense and it's general upper limit is a day.

## Voice Activity
Within the Secret Lab server, staff members are expected to use verbal communication to confront issues directly before they get out of hand or continue. Due to this, all staff members are required to have a functional mic that they are not afraid to use.

Within the Discord server, text communication is perfectly acceptable for warnings and confrontations.

## Smaller Points
A few smallers things that don't necessitate their own section:
- **Server Advertisement** - Please do not advertise or gush over our server while playing on other servers.
- **Other Servers** - You are definitely allowed to play on whatever server you like, and even talk about them, so long as you do put some effort into helping moderate our server.
- **Recording Gameplay** - This is not necessary, but if you would like to record your gameplay to give proof for disputes against bans or warnings, it would be appreciated. A great method for this would be GEFORCE Experience's "Instant Replay" which allows you to on-demand save the previous few minutes as a local recording.
- **Volunteering** - As of right now, the server has no method of income, the monthly rent for it comes out of the owner's pocket. We're considering a method for monetization, such as Patreon, in which any profit beyond the monthly server rent would be split between staff members. Until then, staff on this server is essentially volunteer work.
